- Verifies installation, update mechanism, and uninstallation
- Tests installation dependencies and requirements
- Validates proper cleanup and package integrity

### 4. Security Audit (`tests/security/`)

**Security Tests** (`security_audit_test.go`)
- Credential storage security validation
- Authentication flow vulnerability testing

- Memory security and sensitive data handling

### 5. Documentation Verification (`tests/e2e/`)

**Documentation Tests** (`documentation_test.go`)
- Validates all documented features work as described
- Tests README examples and command documentation
- Verifies help text accuracy and completeness
- Checks configuration documentation and man page generation
- Identifies documentation gaps and inconsistencies

## Test Execution Framework

### Automated Test Runners

**Linux/macOS** (`scripts/run-e2e-tests.sh`)
- Comprehensive bash script for Unix-like systems
- Runs all test suites with proper error handling
- Generates detailed reports and coverage analysis
- Supports verbose mode and configurable timeouts

**Windows** (`scripts/run-e2e-tests.ps1`)
- PowerShell equivalent for Windows systems
- Same functionality as bash script with Windows-specific adaptations
- Proper error handling and report generation

# Windows
.\scripts\run-e2e-tests.ps1
```

### Individual Test Suites

```bash
# System tests
go test -v ./tests/system/...

# Security tests  
go test -v ./tests/security/...

# Documentation tests
go test -v ./tests/e2e/...

# Distribution tests
go test -v ./tests/distribution/...
```
